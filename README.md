User Manual:

This software is designed to help you create the ideal study environment by monitoring key factors that impact focus and productivity. The software integrates heart rate, sound, temperature, and light sensors to provide real-time feedback on your environment and stress levels. It tracks your heart rate to detect moments of stress. Sound sensors monitor noise levels to ensure a quiet, distraction-free space. Temperature sensors adjust the environment for comfort, while light sensors optimize lighting conditions to reduce eye strain. Together, these features work to create a personalized study atmosphere, helping you stay focused, relaxed, and productive.
